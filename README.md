[Photo Location](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Dzvm638jq-photo-location) functionality revolves around analyzing uploaded images to precisely determine where each photo was taken. This involves scrutinizing various elements within the image, including landmarks, natural features, architectural styles, and even weather conditions, to make educated guesses about the location. Striving for pinpoint accuracy, the analyst communicates when there's insufficient information in the image for a precise estimation and may request additional context when needed. The primary aim remains to maintain privacy standards and avoid disclosing sensitive information through assumptions.
